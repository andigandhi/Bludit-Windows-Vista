# 98.css - Bludit Theme

A Windows98 based, interactive Theme for the content management system [Bludit](https://www.bludit.com/) based on the great work of [jdan](https://github.com/jdan/98.css).

A demonstration of the theme can be seen on my [personal homepage](https://andi.grasserisen.de).

## Installation

After [installing the Bludit CMS](https://docs.bludit.com/en/getting-started/installation-guide) just unpack or clone the repository into the subfolder *bl-themes*.
Then select the theme in the */admin* panel.

## Managing content

As this theme is not a usual Bludit theme, it requires some special preparation of the content.

- The icons for the "desktop links" and the "start menu entries" can be set by changing the cover image of articles
- Articles usually show up in the start menu. If they should appear as a desktop icon, you have to set the type of the article to "static".
